## Encryption

All encryption operations use libsodium's asymmetric [sealed_box](https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes) primitive through the [crypto_box](https://crates.io/crates/crypto_box) crate. A randomness source is required for sealed boxes to generate ephemeral key pairs for sealing. See [Cryptography](/world-app/cryptography) for more details on the randomness source.

## Apple Keychain

TODO: Details coming soon.
